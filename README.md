# MediaKit

A collection of extended functionalities to the media frameworks. 

## Overview

The framework aims to provide additional methods for the structures defined within `PDFKit` and `AVFoundation`.

## Getting Started

`MediaKit` uses [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/) as its build tool. If you want to import in your own project, it's as simple as adding a `dependencies` clause to your `Package.swift`:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://www.github.com/Vaida12345/MediaKit", branch: "main")
]
```
and then adding the appropriate module to your target dependencies.

### Using Xcode Package support

You can add this framework as a dependency to your Xcode project by clicking File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency. The package is located at:
```

```
